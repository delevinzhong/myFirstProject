Step 1. Download and install the remote agent
1.	Create a directory on the agent machine (e.g. /home/bamboo-agent-home) to server as the Bamboo agent home for the remote agent.
2.	Download Remote Agent JAR and save the JAR file to the directory on the agent machine that you created above. (e.g. /home/bamboo-agent-home/XXXXX.jar) 
Step 2. Launch the remote agent
	Run commands like below to install the agent:
java -jar atlassian-bamboo-agent-installer-5.6.3.jar https://bamboo.service.dev/agentServer/
 Step 3. Add self signed certification
1.	CD to Java bin folder (note that need JDK1.7)
2.	Import self signed certification
./keytool –import –alias globaltest –file /<path>/globaltest-root-ca.cer
Enter keystore password:
(for globaltest-root-ca.cer, need to open the browser and go to http://bamboo.service.dev, click the certificate to download it.)
Trust this certificate? [no]: yes
./keytool –import –alias globaltest-bamboo –file /<path>/bamboo.cer
Enter keystore password:
Trust this certificate? [no]: yes
3.	CD to bamboo home: cd /home/bamboo-agent-home, and then change the wrapper.conf file.
cd /bamboo-agent-home/conf/
vi wrapper.conf
add the follow statements:
wrapper.java.additional.3=-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=/<path>/.keystore
wrapper.java.additional.4=-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=********(enter your password when you set during importing the self-signed certification)
wrapper.java.additional.5=-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/<path>/.keystore
4.	CD to bin folder, run the bamboo-agent.sh.
cd/bin
./bamboo-agent.sh start
5.	Check whether it runs successfully.
ps –ef | grep bamboo
Step 4. Approve access in Bamboo
